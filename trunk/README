MooseX::AttributeCloner

The purpose of this Role is to take all the attributes which have values in the current class,
and populate them directly into a new class object. The purpose of which is that if you have data
inputted on the command line that needs to propagate through to later class objects, you shouldn't
need to do the following


my $oNewClass = New::Class->new({
  attr1 => $self->attr1,
  attr2 => $self->attr2,
...
});

Which is going to get, quite frankly, tedious in the extreme. Particularly when you have more than
2 class objects in your chain.
